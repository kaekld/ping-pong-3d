# Ping-Pang
Ping-Pang is a small video game made with Godot Engine and GDScript. As you might guess, itâ€™s a classic 3D Ping-Pong game. Iâ€™m planning to add some features to give it my own touch so it doesnâ€™t stay too simple. For now, itâ€™s designed to support only local multiplayer and CPU opponents.

ðŸ’– I will be updating it as I complete some of the main development goals, and afterwards Iâ€™ll consider fixing bugs and adding additional features.
